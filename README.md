A repo for my 3d printable keyboard design

It works (mechanically), I printed it on a robo3d, but never got around to wiring it up.  Should be easy enough to get it going with some of the other instructions out there, like for the ergodox.  
The keys are sized for cherrys.  I tested on a few brand new browns, and they seem to do just fine.  Spacing for the caps is based on Rosewill's cheap set of caps.
